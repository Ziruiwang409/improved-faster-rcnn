# DCNv2 Pytorch Version 
- source code from [DCNv2_latest](https://github.com/lucasjinreal/DCNv2_latest)

- Add support for pytorch1.11 (may be not backward-compatible). 
- Test on ubuntu20.04, python3.8(conda), cuda_11.4

It was confirmed that pytorch1.11 worked, but not compatible with previous pytorch version. If you want pytorch1.10 or earlier, please using pytorch1.6 branch, or using last git commit.

It's suggested using latest stable pytorch 1.11 to start your project.


## Install

```bash
$ python setup.py build develop
```
